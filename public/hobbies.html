  <h1>My hobbies and life</h1>
  <p>My hobbies for now include programming and spending precious time with my son and wife.</p>
  <p>Whenever i can squeeze some free time out of my day i like to sit in front of my laptop and just code. It's difficult to just stop and do something else.</p>
  <p>The most important thing in my life however is my son. We love being silly together, we laugh and play as much as we can. He is my sun and stars.</p>
